Finally, test the correctness of your algorithm on the contact lenses [dataset](contact_lenses.csv) discussed in class, to see if it produces the same rules.\n",

    "- Advice: work on the  algorithm implementation in IDE (such as Pycharm). This will allow to fix bugs easily. \n",
    "- After your algorithm works, you can copy it step-by-step to a new notebook and explain each step.\n",
    "- Use `pandas` and `numpy` whenever possible to make the program faster (See an example in Section 4 of this notebook).\n",
    "- Use list comprehensions instead of loops - these run at least 10 times faster than native Python loops.\n",
    "- __Important:__ you do not have to use the starter logic below. You can write your own code from scratch. The goal was to help you, not to constrain your creativity to my way of thinking about the problem.\n"
